# Cholesky Decomposition

The Cholesky decompositon of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix $A$, is a decomposition of the form:

$$A = LL^{*}$$

where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries and $L^{*}$ denotes the conjugate transpose of $L$.

**Theorem**: Every Hermition positive-definite matrix (and thus every real-valued symmetric positive-definite matrix) has a unique Cholesky decomposition.

The converse holds trivially - if $A$ can be written as $LL^{*}$ for some invertible $L$, lower-triangular or not, then $A$ is Hermitian and positive-definite.

For real matrix $A$ we write:

$$A = LL^{T}$$

where $L$ is a real lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries.
